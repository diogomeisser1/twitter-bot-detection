# 🐦 Twitter Bot Detection

This project uses machine learning models in R to detect social spambots on Twitter based on user- and tweet-level metadata. We focus specifically on bot activity surrounding Italian political discourse using the **Cresci 2017 Social Spambot dataset**.

📄 **Full Report**: [`Final_Report.pdf`](./Final_Report.pdf)  
👨‍💻 Developed by Diogo Meisser, Daniel Mardani, and Alexis Navarro  
📚 Built for STAT 654: Statistical Computing with R and Python

## ⚠️ Data Availability

> **Note:** Due to large file size (over 1 GB), the datasets are **not included** in this repository.  
> However, all code remains reproducible if you manually download and place the datasets as shown below.

### 📦 Download Instructions

You can obtain the original data from:

- **Cresci et al. (2017)** — [Social Spambot Repository](https://botometer.osome.iu.edu/bot-repository/datasets.html)

We used the following folders:
- `social_spambots_1`
- `genuine_accounts

## 🧪 How to Run

To run the full classification pipeline:

```r
source("r-code/05_Full_Code.R")
```

You can also execute scripts step-by-step for greater control. Each R script loads its own libraries.  
Use `install.packages()` if prompted.

## 🔍 Methodology Summary

- **Data Merging**: Tweet-level and user-level data were aggregated and joined on `user_id`
- **Feature Engineering**: Created 24 final features including averages, counts, and ratios
- **Preprocessing**: Removed high-collinearity variables (threshold > 0.8)
- **Scaling**: Standardized inputs for distance-based models like k-NN
- **Validation**: 5-fold Cross-Validation for Lasso and k-NN parameter tuning
- **Outliers**: Preserved due to relevance and manual verification in Cresci dataset

## 🧠 Models Used

| Model                        | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| **Lasso Logistic Regression** | Shrinks and selects features using L1 penalty |
| **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** | Assumes normality, equal covariances |
| **Random Forest** | Non-parametric ensemble method using bootstrapped trees |
| **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** | Classifies based on proximity to known users |

## 📊 Results Summary

| Model         | Accuracy | Sensitivity (Bot) | Specificity (Human) |
|---------------|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Lasso         | 97.6%    | 97.8%             | 97.4%               |
| LDA           | 97.1%    | 96.9%             | 97.4%               |
| Random Forest | **98.3%**| **99.6%**         | 96.8%               |
| k-NN (k = 5)  | 97.6%    | 99.4%             | 96.1%               |

✅ **Random Forest** performed best, especially in detecting bots.
